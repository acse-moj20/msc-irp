## Prediction and Data Assimilation Using Generative Models for 2D Turbulent Fluid Modelling


## About The Project

This project was completed as part of fulfillment of Msc in Applied Computational Science and Engineering (ACSE) requirement at the Department of Earth Science and Engineering, Imperial College London. 

### Dataset 
The dataset in this project comprises of 12,000 trajectories of 2-d vortices representing parameter varying flow in a box. The domain is a 256-by-256 grid cells with a time domain of 100s and 0.01s time discretisation. Snapshots of the data are captured every 2s resulting in 50 snapshots per trajectory. A sample trjectory is shown below. The parameters used in generating the dataset are as follows:
 - _Re_ = 5000
 - Constant viscosity
 - Boundary condition: no slip walls
